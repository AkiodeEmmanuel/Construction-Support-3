# Project Title: Oyo Field Re-Entry; Recovery and Installation of Hydraulic Flying Leads
## Project Overview
This project involved the re-entry of the Oyo Field for the recovery and installation of hydraulic flying leads, essential components for subsea operations. The work required precise surface and subsea positioning to support ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) dive operations and ensure the successful installation and recovery of subsea assets.

## Project Details
- **Date:** December 2022 – January 2023  
- **Scope:** ROV Dive Support, Surface and Underwater Positioning  
- **Project Role:** Online Surveyor  
- **Vessel:** TOPAZ RESOLVE  
- **ROV:** Triton XLX 52
- **Client:** The Nigeria Agip Exploration
- **Project Location**: Oyo Field Nigeria OML blocks 120 and 121

## Responsibilities
- **Surface and Subsea Positioning:**  
  Provided precise surface and subsea positioning data using DGPS and other navigation systems to guide accurate ROV operations.  
- **ROV Overlay Data Creation:**  
  Developed and transmitted overlay data for the ROV to assist in navigation and task execution.  
- **Real-time Monitoring:**  
  Tracked the ROV’s position and movement using underwater positioning systems such as USBL (Ultra-Short Baseline).  
- **System Calibration:**  
  Conducted calibration and verification of underwater positioning systems to ensure accuracy and reliability in data collection.  
- **Touchdown Monitoring:**  
  Monitored touchdown events during the installation process using ROV-mounted beacons.
